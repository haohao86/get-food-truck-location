get-food-trucks
===============

A web app that tells the user what types of food trucks might be found near a specific location on a map.


Write your README as if it was for a production service, and include the following items:

The project you chose (departure times, SF movies, email service or food trucks)
The technical track you chose (full stack, back-end or front-end)
Reasoning behind your technical choices (and level of experience with those)
Trade-offs you might have made, anything you left out, or what you might do differently if you were to spend additional time on the project
Link to other code you're particularly proud of
Link to your resume or public profile

You are also free to use any web framework. If you choose to use a framework that results in boilerplate code in the repository, please detail in your README which code was written by you (as opposed to generated code).
